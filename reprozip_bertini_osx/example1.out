(using GMP v5.0.5, MPFR v3.1.1)



NOTE: You have requested to use adaptive path tracking.  Please make sure that you have
setup the following tolerances appropriately:
CoeffBound: 1.916740000000e+00, DegreeBound: 2.000000000000e+00
AMPSafetyDigits1: 1, AMPSafetyDigits2: 1, AMPMaxPrec: 1024

Tracking path 0 of 4

Finite Solution Summary

NOTE: nonsingular vs singular is based on condition number and identical endpoints

		| Number of real solns	|  Number of non-real solns	|  Total
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-singular	|	2		|		0		|   2
Singular	|	0		|		0		|   0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total		|	2		|		0		|   2


Finite Multiplicity Summary

  Multiplicity	|  Number of real solns	|  Number of non-real solns
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1	|	2		|	0

The following files may be of interest to you:

main_data:             A human-readable version of the solutions - main output file.
raw_solutions:         A list of the solutions with the corresponding path numbers.
raw_data:              Similar to the previous, but with the points in Bertini's homogeneous
                         coordinates along with more information about the solutions.
real_finite_solutions: A list of all real finite solutions.
finite_solutions:      A list of all finite solutions.
nonsingular_solutions: A list of all nonsingular solutions.
singular_solutions:    A list of all singular solutions.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Paths Tracked: 4
 Truncated infinite paths: 2 - try adjusting SecurityMaxNorm or set SecurityLevel to 1 in the input file
   Please see 'failed_paths' for more information about these paths.
